Project 3: X-Ray Classification - Covid detection
=====================================================

Synopsis:
---------

The goal of this competition is to classify a dataset of X-Ray lung images into 4 classes. 

The 4 classes are:

* Covid-19: lung images of Covid-19 patients.
* Lung opacity (ground-glass opacity): images of lungs showing areas of hazy opacification or increased attenuation (CT) due to air displacement by fluid, airway collapse, fibrosis, or a neoplastic process.
* Pneumonia: lung images of viral pneumonia patients.
* Normal: lung images of healthy patients.
